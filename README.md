# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Pyber, a ride-Sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion, has hired Data Analyst Inc. (“DAI”) to analyze all the rideshare data from January to late April 2019 and present the findings to the CEO V. Isualize.
For this purpose, DAI has prepared:
  -	A summary of actual ride-sharing data by city type (i.e., Rural, Suburban and Urban). 
  -	A summary of weekly fares by city type (as noted above) presented in a line chart visual.
  -	Recommendations for business improvement 

## Results
DAI analyzed city and ride data provided by PyBer.  DAI worked with Omar, a PyBer employee, to determine meaningful measurements and summarized this data as follows

**PyBer Ride Sharing Data Summary by City Type:**

Ride-shares in the Urban cities dominated the market for the 4-month time-period of January 2019 through April 2019.  Urban city total fares over this period (close to. $40,000, 63% of total fares) outpaced rural fares by 9 times and suburban fares by 2 times. Urban cities provided 81% of all drivers and 68% of all rides taken.  Suburban cities provided 16% of all drivers and 26% of all rides taken.  Rural cities provided only 3% of all drivers and 5% of all rides.  The average fare per ride was highest among rural rides at $34.62 most likely due to lower demand, longer rides and higher gas cost.  Suburban cities followed with $30.97 per ride and urban cities at $24.53 per ride.  Fares per driver were highest in rural cities at $55.49 followed by suburban cities at $39.50 and then urban cities at $16.57.

To further support our analysis a study of the average fares by city type by week over the 4-month period were gathered and plotted on a line chart.  The chart is presented as follows:

This data depicts visually the dominance Urban cities has had on the company’s total fares over the 4-month period.  While there are some small spikes in all fares over the time period, the disparities between the city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) remained relatively constant and doesn’t differ from the data presented in the summary above.  In general Urban cities dominated with suburban cites coming in second and rural cities falling considerably behind.  

## Summary
Based on DAI’s analysis, the following items for consideration are recommended here:  
*	***Increase drivers in suburban and rural areas:*** The data above indicates one reason for Urban cities success is due to a plethora of drivers.  Urban cities have 81% of all drivers.  PyBer can hold out more incentives to drivers in the rural and suburban areas as well as increase advertising in these areas to test whether this can drive up fares in the respective areas.
*	***Prioritize suburban business investment over the rural focus:*** Suburban fares were only one-half as much as the Urban cities with only  16% of the drivers which indicates a more efficient use of drivers so further enhancing the driver pool in suburban areas may bring more fares for each PyBer investment dollar. 
*	***Study when ride-sharing is most used during a day’s time-period for the different city types:***  Ride-shares in the urban areas may take place all throughout the day where ride-shares in suburban and rural areas may heavily concentrate in the mornings and late afternoons and follow a rush hour pattern.  If this holds true investment dollars should be focused on recruiting more drivers during these morning and afternoon time periods and not as much during the day.

This study has provided PyBer valuable information which will enhance future business development.
